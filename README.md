# Tower-Of-Hanoi
This is a simple Tower of Hanoi (game, if you call it) using C++. 
If recursion is what you want to brush up, then this is your playground.

This is just a simple implementation of recursion in C++, and a fun pass time project to do when you're at Starbucks waiting for your friend :)

Feel free to use it as you like ;-)
